# AutoMate Bug Tracker

Hi! You found the public bug tracker for [AutoMate](), a car maintenance tracking app. If you run into troubles, please submit an issue here. It's quick and straight forward. I'll be actively monitoring this repo for new Issues.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** AutoMate is still a work in progress and is not in the public iOS App Store. Feel free to download the public TestFlight(beta) version of the app: https://testflight.apple.com/join/WwJH6tyO

### How to submit a bug

To create an issue you have to create a GitHub account. Fear not, it's quick, easy and will help make AutoMate better. All you need to do is create a username, supply an email address, and create a password. Bonus, it's all free! 

* Create a GitHub account here: https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home

* Once you have your account created, click the "Issues" tab above or click this link: https://github.com/miotke/AutoMate_bugs/issues

* If you already have a GitHub account, great! Head over to the Issues tab and submit your bug. 


### Why use GitHub for bug tracking

GitHub is really great and well suited for bug tracking. It also allows me to keep everything in one place. Using GitHub also allows you to search for already created Issues that have been submitted. Don't worry if you submit a duplicate. I would rather know about something multiple times vs not knowing about it at all. 

### Issue discussions

GitHub issues allow for discussions in a really well formatted way. On top of your submission, others may want to chime in on that particular issue. It also allows me to jump in so we can find a resolution and I can ship you an update. 

### What about feature requests? 

Feel free to submit a feature request as well. Use the Feature Request template when clicking the Issues tab. 

### What if I want to look for the history of changes?

Check out the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/miotke/AutoMate_bugs/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)! This will be updated for every major and minor version of AutoMate.
